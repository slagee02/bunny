        <h2>Low maintenance</h2>
        <p>
        Bunnies are not that difficult to take care of nor as expensive as other pets such as dogs and cats. The biggest 
        expense is the initial setup, and toys can even be homemade if you want to save some extra bucks! Bunnies love 
        cardboard. The care steps are very simple to follow too. Even better, Rabbits can be easily litterbox trained which really makes things easy.
        </p> 
        <h2>Stress-relieving</h2>
        <p> 
        Bunnies absolutely can be the sweetest pets. They can be quite cuddly and become very bonded to their owners to the 
        point where they are begging for cuddles and attention! If you’re having a rough day, you’ll come home to see their 
        sweet little faces staring up at you ready to play and make you happy! My bunny absolutely loves to be petted, and 
        nearly falls asleep when he gets pets. I have to say the process is deeply therapeutic! The bonding also lasts a 
        while as bunnies live to be 7-10 years.</p>

        <h2>They have silly personalities </h2>
        Bunnies truly have big personalities and its very entertaining to see. My rabbit, for example, is extremely energetic,
        smart, and a little destructive (in a really funny way). When he gets really excited, he throws his food bowl and all
        his toys everywhere and it's hilarious! He’s also extremely curious, as soon as he gets the chance to leave his cage
        he is everywhere sniffing with his cute little nose and standing on his hind legs to get a better look at things! 
        If you’re looking for entertainment, a bunny may be the pet for you!
        
        <h2>Take bunnies out of shelters</h2> 
        <p>Bunnies often get abandoned and so they need us to adopt them and give them happy homes!</p>
