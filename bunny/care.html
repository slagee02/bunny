        <h1>Caring For Your Very First Rabbit</h1>
        <p>
            Caring for a bunny is honestly pretty easy, and an interesting experience because it teaches you routine, and the 
            responsibility needed to not only take care of a bunny, but also yourself. Something funny I’ve noticed is that since
            I’ve been making sure my rabbit eats well, I’ve been eating well too! I wake up early enough to feed him, I check on
            him a lot, I play with him when he’s most active, and I make him a nice little dinner of veggies! Another essential 
            part of care is cleaning! A rabbit’s cage tends to get a little messy, especially if they are not litter box trained.
            I spot-clean my rabbit's cage 1-2 times a day and fully clean the whole habitat every 1-2 weeks depending on how messy
            he gets. Rabbits like to be neat but when they get excited, they make little messes sometimes. It is also important
            to groom your rabbit too and keep its nails at a reasonable length (for their and your benefit!).</p>
        <p>
            There are three main areas to focus on when it comes to caring for a rabbit. The first one would be basic care which deals 
            with maintaining its habitat and basic needs such as food, water, hay, and other supplies needed to make sure your bunny is 
            doing its best. The next thing to focus on is the diet so that you can promote your rabbit’s health. It is also essential to 
            make sure your rabbit is getting exercise and has play time so that it can be happy! I dig deeper into those three categories 
            if you click on the links to the left!</p>
