        <h2>What do Bunnies Eat?</h2>
        <p>
            A rabbit’s diet should consist of a variety of things, but hay should make up the majority of their diet and they should have 
            unlimited access to it. It's good not only for consumption but to keep their teeth in good health! Leafy greens are the next 
            essential part of a bunny rabbit’s diet. Rabbits should be provided with a considerable amount of leafy greens a day as it
            keeps them super healthy and happy! Thumper has taken a great liking to romaine lettuce and cilantro! He also enjoys a spring
            mix. He’s about 7.5 pounds and eats around 2-3 cups of leafy greens a day. Next is pellets, my bunny eats around half a cup 
            of pellets a day. Next after the leafy greens is veggies! Thumper’s favorite vegetables are bell peppers! Bunnies enjoy fruits
            too, but these should be limited or offered as treats. Thumper absolutely loves blueberries; he accidentally bit me once because
            he was so excited when I was giving them to him! It was really funny because he had never bitten me before, and he hasn’t bitten
            me since; it kind of reminds me of the Trix cereal commercials!
