            The best way to keep your rabbit happy is to keep them busy! Bunnies are very playful creatures and have 
            so much energy they need to let out. It's extremely important that you give them the time to explore, 
            the space to play, and enough toys to keep them happy! A happy bunny is a healthy bunny and a healthy bunny is
            a happy bunny! If you are a quite busy person you might want to considering getting two bunnies so they can play together!

        </p>

        <h2>Chewing</h2>
        <p>Chewing is very important for rabbits because they have teeth that never stop growing, and chewing on things helps keep their
            teeth at healthy lengths. One thing to watch out for though is that bunnies may end up chewing things you don’t necessarily 
            want them to if you let them out. For this, it's important to bunny-proof your house if you let them out for playtime.</p>

        <h2>Rabbit Proofing</h2>
        <p>You should designate a place in your house for your rabbit to roam safely, away from dangerous and valuable objects they may
            get into. Bunnies also love to go under furniture which can be dangerous, so it is important to restrict their access to certain
            areas. I remember when I first got Thumper and I was trying to feed him his medicine, he hopped out of my arms and ran under
            the bed! He was being stubborn for nearly 15 minutes. Only bell peppers led him out!</p>

        <h2>Playtime</h2>
        <p>Bunnies, like dogs, love to play fetch! It’s the absolute cutest to see them grab a ball and throw it as far as they can too! 
            There are many toy options, but my bunny’s favorite seems to be empty toiler paper rolls filled with hay, or any hay-based toys 
            he can comfortably throw and chew on. Bunnies require attention and fun to stay happy so it's important to play with them whenever
            you get the chance.
