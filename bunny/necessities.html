        <h1 id="need"> The Basics to Getting a New Bunny!</h1>
        <h2>Steps if You're Looking to Buy a Rabbit</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Research and visit your local animal shelter or contact a breeder to find the bunny of your dreams</li>
            <li>Spend some time with the bunny, bunnies have such different personalities it’s great to find the one you’re most compatible with!</li>
            <li>Get to Shopping! You need to create the best possible environment for your bunny (more details below)</li>
            <li>Bunny-proof your house. It’s important for your bunnies to have some time outside of the cage so you need to make sure that can occur safely.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Items Checklist</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A very large cage/another large habitat.
                <ul>
                    <li>Rabbits need enough space to comfortably hop about and play! A quick google search can tell you the size cage you need and where to find one </li>
                    <li>Don’t rely on the starter kit pet shops may provide, the cages tend to be too small and rabbits should only reside there for a short period of time.</li>
                </ul> 
            </li>
            
            <li>Unlimited hay and a hay holder</li>
            <li>Ceramic food bowl, plastic water bottle, and food pellets
                <ul>
                    <li>A water dish can be used but is not recommended as they can get knocked over or dirty easily.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>A Hideaway
                <ul>
                    <li>Your bunny would love a place to hide away in and feel completely secure.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Litterbox and pellets (or some other bunny-safe litter material)</li>
            <li>Toys!</li>
            <li>Grooming supplies
                <ul>
                    <li>Brush/comb</li>
                    <li>Nail clippers</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>bedding</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Litterbox Training</h2>
        <p>It’s honestly not that hard to potty train a rabbit, as they are quite intelligent animals. I was a little nervous 
            when I got my bunny since he was the only rabbit who wasn’t using the litterbox. I was very surprised at how quickly
            he learned to start using it. There were only a few steps I took to get him to learn as well. Firstly, when he would
            poop outside of the litterbox, I would put it in the litterbox so that he realizes that’s where he should let nature
            take its course! Secondly I put his hay right by his litterbox because he loves to eat it when he’s going, so he became 
            more comfortable using the litterbox. Lastly, I would reward him when he used the litterbox. In no time I had a pretty 
            trained rabbit! If your rabbit is having trouble, no worries they’ll pick it up eventually (they can be stubborn sometimes)!</p>
