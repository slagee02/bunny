        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Above is my little sweetheart Thumper! He is 1 year old and he has done nothing but bring me the most joy possible.
        I had previously been a hamster owner, and after she passed, I was quite upset. Caring for others, especially animals, 
        is something that I truly love to do and feel incomplete without. Although upsetting, this event led me to make the greatest decision 
        of my life - adopting Thumper! From the moment I saw him at our local animal shelter, I knew he was the one for me. His big ears, 
        twitching little nose, and big eyes were absolutely adorable and he stole my heart. His crazy, playful, stubborn attitude drew me 
        in as well. I remember when I met him, he was so excited to be able to hop around he nearly hurt himself! Since I brought him home
        I’ve had quite the experience which I truly do recommend others consider having!</p>
        <p>Bunnies really do make amazing pets but it’s a shame most people would rather get a cat or dog. I hope that through this site, I am able to show anyone who may be viewing how fun, beneficial, and easy it is to be a rabbit owner. Rabbits are the silliest, low-maintenance, most interesting animals to own. If you’re looking for a long-term best friend a rabbit is for you!
        If you do plan on becoming a bunny owner, please make sure you take the proper steps to make your bunny one healthy and happy hopper! Please take advantage of the resources and advice I have provided throughout this website.
